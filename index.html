            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>When people think of historic NFL defenses, often the 2000 Ravens, '85 Bears,
              and the Pittsburgh <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/399144-pittsburgh-steelers-the-steel-curtain">"Steel Curtain"</a>
              of the '70s come to mind. The 1977 Atlanta Falcons defense is often never thought about by the common fan,
              but the reality is that statistically they arguably trump them all. This defense is responsible for the NFL record
              for fewest points allowed in a single season, giving up only <b>129</b> points through 14 games. This may not
              seem as significant, since the NFL has increased the regular season game count to 16 (and now 17)
              games, but this Falcons team also allowed the fewest points per game in NFL history, with an
              astonishing <b>9.2</b> PPG.
            </p>

        <div id="Why">
            <h2>Why</h2>
            <p>There is one major difference between the 1977 Atlanta Falcons and these other more memorable defensive teams:
              those teams won the Super Bowl. The '77 Falcons on the other hand, despite their record breaking defense,
              couldn't even make the playoffs. This was a feat so bizarre that the only thing that could scratch the surface
              in the modern era were the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_San_Diego_Chargers_season">2010 San Diego Chargers </a>,
              who missed the postseason despite having the league's number 1 offense and defense that year.
            </p>
            <p>Here is a game log for the Falcons' unfortunate 7-7 season that year:</p>

                <img src="images/jerryglanville.png" alt="Jerry Glanville" />
                <h3>Were they Good</h3>
                <p>The defense's key to dominance was the introduction of a new scheme
                  the rest of the league simply didn't have an answer for.
                </p>
                <p> Spearheaded by defensive assistant <b>Jerry Glanville</b> (right)
                  was a playstyle he deemed the "Grits Blitz." Better known in modern
                  times as the 46 Defense, this scheme made life a living hell for
                  opposing quarterbacks in that time period. The rest of the league
                  ended up figuring out answers to such a defensive attack the year
                  after, and as a result the Falcons defense never was the same.

                <h3>Were they Bad</h3>
                <p> As if it wasn't blatantly apparent by the final scores of the games
                  shown above, the major issue with this team was their offense, and more
                  specifically, their quarterback play. Pictured below are the regular
                  season numbers for the two quarterbacks that started games for the
                  Falcons in 1977, Steve Bartkowski (left) and Scott Hunter (right).
                  These attrocious numbers show you everything you need to know about
                  the team's struggles in winning football games.
